# SEO/AEO Glossary

Shared terminology reference for all SEO/AEO skills. Each skill's output should annotate technical terms on first use with a parenthetical explanation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) | Optimizing content to be cited by AI search engines such as Google AI Overview, Perplexity, and ChatGPT Search. |
| BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) | A writing pattern that places the conclusion or direct answer at the beginning of a section. AI engines prefer 30-60 word direct answers at the start of each section for citation extraction. |
| JSON-LD (JSON for Linking Data) | A structured data format that helps search engines understand page content. Embedded via `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags. |
| E-E-A-T | Google's quality evaluation criteria: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Higher E-E-A-T signals correlate with better rankings and AI citation rates. |
| CTR (Click-Through Rate) | The ratio of clicks to impressions in search results. CTR = Clicks / Impressions. Low CTR with high impressions suggests the title or meta description needs improvement. |
| Schema Markup | Structured data annotations for search engines. Common types include FAQ, HowTo, Article, and BreadcrumbList. Sites with 3+ schema types show ~13% higher AI citation rates. |
| Canonical URL | The preferred URL for a page when duplicates exist. Specified via `<link rel="canonical">` to consolidate ranking signals. |
| Keyword Cannibalization | When multiple pages on the same site compete for the same keyword, splitting ranking signals and reducing overall visibility. |
| Search Appearance | How a page displays in search results, including rich results, FAQ dropdowns, and featured snippets. |
| Position | Average ranking in Google search results (1.0 = top). Position 8-20 keywords are "striking distance" quick wins. |
| Impressions | The number of times a page appeared in search results, regardless of whether users clicked. |
| Quick Wins | Keywords ranking at position 8-20 with significant impressions (>100). These are close to page 1 and offer the highest ROI for optimization. |
| Rich Results | Enhanced search result displays powered by structured data, such as FAQ accordions, how-to steps, and review stars. |
| Featured Snippet | A highlighted answer box at the top of Google search results (position 0). BLUF-formatted content with 30-60 words is most likely to be selected. |
| Striking Distance | Keywords ranking just outside page 1 (typically position 8-20) that can reach page 1 with targeted optimization. |
