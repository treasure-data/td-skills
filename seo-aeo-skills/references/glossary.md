# SEO/AEO Glossary

Shared terminology reference for all SEO/AEO skills. Each skill's output should annotate technical terms on first use with a parenthetical explanation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) | Optimizing content to be cited by AI search engines such as Google AI Overview, Perplexity, and ChatGPT Search. |
| BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) | A writing pattern that places the conclusion or direct answer at the beginning of a section. AI engines prefer 30-60 word direct answers at the start of each section for citation extraction. |
| JSON-LD (JSON for Linking Data) | A structured data format that helps search engines understand page content. Embedded via `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags. |
| E-E-A-T | Google's quality evaluation criteria: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Higher E-E-A-T signals correlate with better rankings and AI citation rates. |
| CTR (Click-Through Rate) | The ratio of clicks to impressions in search results. CTR = Clicks / Impressions. Low CTR with high impressions suggests the title or meta description needs improvement. |
| Schema Markup | Structured data annotations for search engines. Common types include FAQ, HowTo, Article, and BreadcrumbList. Sites with 3+ schema types show ~13% higher AI citation rates. |
| Canonical URL | The preferred URL for a page when duplicates exist. Specified via `<link rel="canonical">` to consolidate ranking signals. |
| Keyword Cannibalization | When multiple pages on the same site compete for the same keyword, splitting ranking signals and reducing overall visibility. |
| Search Appearance | How a page displays in search results, including rich results, FAQ dropdowns, and featured snippets. |
| Position | Average ranking in Google search results (1.0 = top). Position 8-20 keywords are "striking distance" quick wins. |
| Impressions | The number of times a page appeared in search results, regardless of whether users clicked. |
| Quick Wins | Keywords ranking at position 8-20 with significant impressions (>100). These are close to page 1 and offer the highest ROI for optimization. |
| Rich Results | Enhanced search result displays powered by structured data, such as FAQ accordions, how-to steps, and review stars. |
| Featured Snippet | A highlighted answer box at the top of Google search results (position 0). BLUF-formatted content with 30-60 words is most likely to be selected. |
| Striking Distance | Keywords ranking just outside page 1 (typically position 8-20) that can reach page 1 with targeted optimization. |
| GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) | Optimizing content specifically for generative AI engines (e.g., Google AI Overview, Perplexity) that synthesize answers rather than list links. Overlaps with AEO but emphasizes generative output formatting. |
| AI Mode | Google's experimental conversational search interface that uses Gemini to generate multi-turn answers with cited sources. Content must be structured for extraction to appear in AI Mode responses. |
| Entity | A uniquely identifiable thing (person, organization, place, concept) that search engines recognize via Knowledge Graph. Entity SEO strengthens topical authority by linking content to recognized entities through structured data (sameAs, about, mainEntity). |
| Topical Authority | A site's demonstrated expertise on a topic cluster, measured by breadth of coverage, internal linking, and search engine trust signals. Higher topical authority correlates with better rankings across all keywords in the cluster. |
| Content Cluster | A group of related pages organized around a pillar page, connected by internal links. Each cluster page targets a specific subtopic while the pillar covers the broad topic. Clusters signal topical authority to search engines. |
| Programmatic SEO | Creating large numbers of pages from templates and data (e.g., "[City] + [Service]" pages). Effective for long-tail keywords but requires unique value per page to avoid thin content penalties. |
| Zero-Click Search | A search where the user's query is answered directly on the SERP (via AI Overview, Answer Box, Knowledge Graph) without clicking through to any website. ~65% of Google searches are now zero-click. |
| llms.txt | A proposed standard file (similar to robots.txt) placed at the site root to provide instructions and context to LLM crawlers about site content, preferred citation format, and content licensing. |
| SERP Alignment | The degree to which a page's content format matches the dominant SERP features for its target keyword. A page targeting an Answer Box keyword should use BLUF format; a page targeting PAA should use question-format headings. |
| Position Drift | The difference between a keyword's average position in GSC (historical) and its live position in current SERP results. Positive drift (live > GSC) indicates ranking decline; negative drift indicates improvement. |
