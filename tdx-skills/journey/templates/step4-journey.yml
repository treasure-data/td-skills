# Step 4: Journey Structure + Stage Steps
# =============================================================================
#
# Build the full journey: skeleton, goal, stage criteria, and steps.
# Segments (Steps 1-2) and activations (Step 3) are already defined.
#
# --- REQUIRED: Confirm with client before writing (do NOT skip) ---
# Ask the client for (if not already provided):
#   - Journey name and description
#   - Reentry mode:
#       no_reentry                    — users enter once only
#       reentry_unless_goal_achieved  — re-enter if goal not yet met
#       reentry_always                — always allow re-entry
#   - Stage names, entry/exit criteria, milestones
#   - Flow for each stage (what steps, what order)
#
# Do NOT invent journey structure. Use segments from Steps 1-2 and
# activations from Step 3 — only reference keys that already exist.
#
# --- Build steps ONE STAGE AT A TIME ---
# Do not write all stages at once.
#
# For each stage:
#   1. Sketch the flow as a comment (MANDATORY — see format below)
#   2. Write steps following the flow
#   3. Run the flow validation checklist (MANDATORY — see below)
#   4. Write the updated YAML, show to client, get confirmation
#   5. Then move to the next stage
#
# =============================================================================
# FLOW CONTROL RULES (CRITICAL)
# =============================================================================
#
# Rule 1: Every branch MUST perform a different action. A branch that merges
#   without doing anything is pointless — if branches do the same thing,
#   there is no reason to branch.
#   This applies to ALL branching types: decision_point, wait condition, ab_test.
#
#   decision_point / ab_test:
#     GOOD: Branch A → Activation X → Merge
#           Branch B → Activation Y → Merge
#     BAD:  Branch A → Merge                  ← No action in branch
#     BAD:  Branch A → Activation X → Merge
#           Branch B → Activation X → Merge   ← Same action, no point branching
#
#   wait condition:
#     GOOD: Matched → Activation X → Merge    ← Different actions per path
#           Timeout → Activation Y → Merge
#     BAD:  Matched → Merge                   ← Both paths do nothing different
#           Timeout → Merge
#     If both paths lead to the same place with no different actions,
#     use a simple duration wait instead of a condition wait.
#
# Rule 2: Multiple paths MUST converge through a Merge step.
#   GOOD: Branch A → Activation → Merge → End
#         Branch B → Activation → Merge
#   BAD:  Branch A → Activation → End       ← Two paths to same End
#         Branch B → Activation → End
#
# Rule 3: Do NOT chain Merge → Merge.
#   GOOD: Merge → Wait → End
#   BAD:  Merge → Merge → End              ← Invalid chain
#
# Rule 4: Always insert a wait step after an activation step.
#   GOOD: Activation → Wait → next step
#   GOOD: Activation → Merge → Wait → End   (wait after merge is OK)
#   BAD:  Activation → Activation            ← No wait between
#
# Rule 5: Single-input Merge is unnecessary.
#   If only one path leads to a Merge, remove it and go directly to next step.
#
# Rule 6: End step must have NO next and NO with.
#
# =============================================================================
# FLOW VALIDATION CHECKLIST (run for EACH stage before writing)
# =============================================================================
#
# After sketching the flow, verify ALL of the following:
#
# [ ] Every branch (decision_point, ab_test, wait condition) performs a different action
# [ ] No branch goes directly to merge without an activation
# [ ] Wait condition paths lead to different actions (otherwise use duration wait)
# [ ] All branching paths converge through a Merge step (not directly to End)
# [ ] No Merge → Merge chains exist
# [ ] Every activation is followed by a wait (or merge then wait)
# [ ] Every next: reference points to a valid step name in THIS stage
# [ ] Stage has exactly one End step with no next/with
# [ ] No orphaned steps (every step is reachable from the first step)
#
# =============================================================================
# FLOW SKETCH FORMAT (MANDATORY before writing steps)
# =============================================================================
#
# Use this format — list every step, show branches with indentation:
#
#   # Flow: [First Step] → [Second Step] → Decision([Branch Names])
#   #       [Branch A] → [Activation] → Merge → Wait → End
#   #       [Branch B] → [Activation] → Merge
#
# =============================================================================
# STEP TYPES QUICK REFERENCE
# =============================================================================
#
#   | Type           | with Parameters                          |
#   |----------------|------------------------------------------|
#   | wait           | duration + unit (day/week) or condition   |
#   | activation     | activation (key from activations section) |
#   | decision_point | branches[] with segment, next             |
#   | ab_test        | variants[] with percentage, next          |
#   | merge          | (none)                                    |
#   | jump           | target with journey, stage                |
#   | end            | (none) — no next or with allowed          |
#
# --- Wait Step Types ---
#   Duration (fixed time delay):
#   - type: wait
#     name: Wait 3 Days
#     next: Next Step
#     with:
#       duration: 3
#       unit: day
#
#   Condition (wait for user action):
#   - type: wait
#     name: Wait for Purchase
#     with:
#       condition:
#         segment: made-purchase     # Segment from Step 2
#         next: follow-up            # Path when matched
#         timeout:                   # Max wait duration
#           duration: 14
#           unit: day
#           next: timeout-path       # Path when timed out
#
# --- After updating the YAML ---
#   1. Write full journey structure with first stage's steps
#   2. Write the updated YAML to the journey file
#   3. Show the stage design to the client and get confirmation.
#      Once confirmed, write the YAML and immediately move to the next stage.
#      Do NOT ask "shall we proceed?" after writing — confirmation was already given.
#   4. Repeat for each remaining stage
#   5. After ALL stages are done, proceed to Step 5 (validate)
