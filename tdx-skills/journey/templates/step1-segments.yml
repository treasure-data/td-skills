# =============================================================================
# Step 1: Segments
# =============================================================================
#
# Build ALL segments the journey needs in a single step:
#   - Goal segment
#   - Stage criteria (entry_criteria, exit_criteria, milestone)
#   - Decision point branches
#   - Wait condition triggers
#
# --- Segment Strategy ---
# Ask the client which approach to use:
#
# Option A: Create new embedded segments (recommended)
#   - Run `tdx sg fields` to discover available attributes and behaviors
#   - Define segments inline in the segments: section
#
# Option B: Reuse existing segments
#   - Run `tdx sg list` to discover existing child segments
#   - Run `tdx sg sql "Segment Name"` to inspect segment rules
#   - Reference with ref: prefix: segment: ref:Existing Segment
#   - Even with this approach, some segments will likely need to be embedded
#
# --- Segment Rule Reference ---
# Use `tdx sg fields` output to build rules. Common operators:
#
#   Equal             Exact match:     value: "true"
#   In                Multiple values: value: ["a", "b"]
#   GreaterEqual      Numeric:         value: 1000
#   LessEqual         Numeric:         value: 7
#   TimeWithinPast    Recency:         value: 7, unit: day
#   TimeBeforePast    Inactivity:      value: 30, unit: day
#   Contain           String contains: value: "@gmail.com"
#
# Behavior aggregation (requires source: behavior_<table_name>):
#   - type: Value
#     attribute: ""                # Empty for behavior count
#     operator:
#       type: GreaterEqual
#       value: 1
#     aggregation:
#       type: Count                # Count | Sum | Avg | Min | Max
#     source: behavior_purchases   # behavior_<table_name>
#
# --- Organization ---
# Group segments by purpose with comments:
#   # -- Goal --
#   # -- Stage 1: Name --
#   # entry_criteria / milestone / exit_criteria / decision_point / wait_condition
#
# --- Wait Condition Segments ---
# Wait steps come in two types. Ask the client which they need:
#
#   1. Duration wait (no segment needed):
#      Wait a fixed number of days/weeks before continuing.
#      Example: "Wait 3 days after sending email"
#
#   2. Condition wait (segment needed):
#      Wait until the user matches a segment, with optional timeout.
#      Example: "Wait until user makes a purchase, up to 7 days"
#      The segment defines the condition to watch for.
#
# For each stage, ask: "Do any wait steps need to watch for a user action
# (condition), or are they all fixed time delays (duration)?"
#
# --- After updating the YAML ---
#   1. Write ONLY the segments: section (no goal, stages, or steps yet)
#   2. Add "# NEW" comments to highlight additions beyond criteria
#   3. Summarize decision/wait structure at the bottom as comments
#   4. Write the updated YAML to the journey file
#   5. Interactive mode: Show the result and STOP. Do NOT ask "proceed?" — just wait.
#      Auto mode: Proceed directly to Step 2
