# Step 1: Journey Skeleton
# =============================================================================
#
# Create the minimal structure: name, description, reentry mode, and stage names.
# This will NOT pass `tdx journey validate` yet — that's expected.
#
# Ask the client for:
#   - Journey name and description
#   - Number of stages and their names
#   - Reentry mode:
#       no_reentry                    — users enter once only
#       reentry_unless_goal_achieved  — re-enter if goal not yet met
#       reentry_always                — always allow re-entry
#
# After creating the file:
#   1. Write the YAML to the journey file
#   2. Show the result to the client
#   3. STOP — wait for client confirmation before proceeding to Step 2
