# =============================================================================
# Step 2: Decision Point & Wait Condition Segments
# =============================================================================
#
# Build segments for decision point branches and wait conditions.
# Criteria segments (goal, entry, exit, milestone) are already done in Step 1.
#
# --- REQUIRED: Plan the stage flows first (do NOT skip) ---
# Before writing segments, you must understand what decisions and waits
# each stage needs. For each stage, ask the client:
#
#   1. What decision points exist? (e.g., "Did user open email?",
#      "What is the user's engagement level?")
#   2. For each decision point, what are the branches?
#      - Which branches need a NEW segment?
#      - Which branches reuse an existing segment from Step 1?
#      - Which branch is the "excluded" catch-all (no segment needed)?
#   3. Are there any condition-based waits?
#      (e.g., "Wait until user makes a purchase, up to 7 days")
#      Duration waits (e.g., "Wait 3 days") do NOT need segments.
#
# --- Discovery (if not already done in Step 1) ---
# Use the same discovery commands as Step 1 to verify attribute names:
#      tdx sg fields
#      tdx query "SELECT column, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 20"
#
# --- Checklist ---
# For EVERY decision point, ensure ALL non-excluded branches have a segment.
# For EVERY condition wait, ensure the trigger condition has a segment.
# Missing even one segment will cause errors in later steps.
#
# --- After updating the YAML ---
#   1. Add the new segments to the segments: section with "# NEW" comments
#   2. Add a structure summary at the bottom as comments
#   3. Write the updated YAML to the journey file
#   4. Show the segment design to the client and get confirmation.
#      Once confirmed, write the YAML and immediately move to Step 3.
#      Do NOT ask "shall we proceed?" after writing — confirmation was already given.
