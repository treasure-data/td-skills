# Trino Query Optimizer

Expert assistance for optimizing Trino query performance and troubleshooting performance issues in Treasure Data environments.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Queries are running too slowly or timing out
- Encountering memory limit errors
- Optimizing existing queries for better performance
- Debugging PAGE_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT errors
- Reducing query costs
- Analyzing query execution plans

## Core Optimization Principles

### 1. Time-Based Partition Pruning (Most Important)

TD tables are partitioned by 1-hour buckets. **Always** filter on time for optimal performance.

**Use TD_INTERVAL or TD_TIME_RANGE:**
```sql
-- Good: Uses partition pruning
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')

-- Good: Explicit time range
WHERE TD_TIME_RANGE(time, '2024-01-01', '2024-01-31')

-- Bad: No time filter - scans entire table!
WHERE user_id = 123  -- Missing time filter
```

**Impact:** Without time filters, queries scan the entire table instead of just relevant partitions, dramatically increasing execution time and cost.

### 2. Column Selection

TD uses columnar storage format. **Select only needed columns.**

```sql
-- Good: Select specific columns
SELECT user_id, event_type, time
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')

-- Bad: SELECT * reads all columns
SELECT *  -- Slower and more expensive
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
```

**Impact:** Each additional column increases I/O. Reading 10 columns vs 50 columns can make a significant performance difference.

### 3. Output Optimization

Use appropriate output methods for your use case.

**CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) - 5x faster than SELECT:**
```sql
-- Best for large result sets
CREATE TABLE analysis_results AS
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  COUNT(*) as events
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1
```

**INSERT INTO - For appending to existing tables:**
```sql
INSERT INTO daily_summary
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  COUNT(*) as events
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1
```

**SELECT with LIMIT - For exploratory queries:**
```sql
-- Good for testing/exploration
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
LIMIT 1000
```

**Impact:** CTAS skips JSON serialization, directly writing to partitioned tables, providing 5x better performance.

### 4. REGEXP_LIKE vs Multiple LIKE Clauses

Replace chained LIKE clauses with REGEXP_LIKE for better performance.

```sql
-- Bad: Multiple LIKE clauses (slow)
WHERE (
  column LIKE '%android%'
  OR column LIKE '%ios%'
  OR column LIKE '%mobile%'
)

-- Good: Single REGEXP_LIKE (fast)
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(column, 'android|ios|mobile')
```

**Impact:** Trino's optimizer cannot efficiently handle multiple LIKE clauses chained with OR, but can optimize REGEXP_LIKE.

### 5. Approximate Functions

Use APPROX_* functions for large-scale aggregations.

```sql
-- Fast: Approximate distinct count
SELECT APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) as unique_users
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')

-- Slow: Exact distinct count (memory intensive)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
```

**Available approximate functions:**
- `APPROX_DISTINCT(column)` - Approximate unique count
- `APPROX_PERCENTILE(column, percentile)` - Approximate percentile (e.g., 0.95 for p95)
- `APPROX_SET(column)` - Returns HyperLogLog sketch for set operations

**Impact:** Approximate functions use HyperLogLog algorithm, dramatically reducing memory usage with ~2% error rate.

### 6. JOIN Optimization

Order joins with smaller tables first when possible.

```sql
-- Good: Small table joined to large table
SELECT l.*, s.attribute
FROM large_table l
JOIN small_lookup s ON l.id = s.id
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(l.time, '-1d', 'JST')

-- Consider: If one table is very small, use a subquery to reduce it first
SELECT e.*
FROM events e
JOIN (
  SELECT user_id
  FROM premium_users
  WHERE subscription_status = 'active'
) p ON e.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(e.time, '-1d', 'JST')
```

**Tips:**
- Always include time filters on all tables in JOIN
- Consider using IN or EXISTS for single-column lookups
- Avoid FULL OUTER JOIN when possible (expensive)

### 7. GROUP BY Optimization

Use column positions in GROUP BY for complex expressions.

```sql
-- Good: Use column positions
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as cnt
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1, 2  -- Cleaner and avoids re-evaluation

-- Works but verbose:
GROUP BY TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST'), event_type
```

### 8. Window Functions Optimization

Partition window functions appropriately to reduce memory usage.

```sql
-- Good: Partition by high-cardinality column
SELECT
  user_id,
  event_time,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time) as seq
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')

-- Be careful: Window over entire dataset (memory intensive)
SELECT
  event_time,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY event_time) as global_seq
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
```

## Common Performance Issues

### Issue: Query Timeout

**Symptoms:**
- Query exceeds maximum execution time
- "Query exceeded maximum time" error

**Solutions:**
1. Add or narrow time filters with TD_INTERVAL/TD_TIME_RANGE
2. Reduce selected columns
3. Use LIMIT for testing before full run
4. Break into smaller queries with intermediate tables
5. Use approximate functions instead of exact aggregations

**Example fix:**
```sql
-- Before: Times out
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'click'

-- After: Much faster
SELECT APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id)
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
  AND event_type = 'click'
```

### Issue: Memory Limit Exceeded

**Symptoms:**
- "Query exceeded per-node memory limit"
- "Query exceeded distributed memory limit"

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce data volume with time filters
2. Use APPROX_DISTINCT instead of COUNT(DISTINCT)
3. Reduce number of columns in SELECT
4. Limit GROUP BY cardinality
5. Optimize JOIN operations
6. Process data in smaller time chunks

**Example fix:**
```sql
-- Before: Memory exceeded
SELECT
  user_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id),
  COUNT(DISTINCT page_url),
  COUNT(DISTINCT referrer)
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
GROUP BY user_id

-- After: Uses approximate functions
SELECT
  user_id,
  APPROX_DISTINCT(session_id) as sessions,
  APPROX_DISTINCT(page_url) as pages,
  APPROX_DISTINCT(referrer) as referrers
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
GROUP BY user_id
```

### Issue: PAGE_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT

**Symptoms:**
- Frequent PAGE_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT errors
- Network-related query failures

**Solutions:**
1. Narrow TD_TIME_RANGE to reduce data volume
2. Reduce number of columns in SELECT
3. Break large queries into smaller time ranges
4. Use CTAS instead of SELECT for large results

**Example fix:**
```sql
-- Before: Transporting too much data
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE TD_TIME_RANGE(time, '2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')

-- After: Process in chunks
SELECT user_id, event_type, time
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
```

### Issue: Slow Aggregations

**Symptoms:**
- COUNT(DISTINCT) taking very long
- Large GROUP BY queries slow

**Solutions:**
1. Use APPROX_DISTINCT instead of COUNT(DISTINCT)
2. Filter data with time range first
3. Consider pre-aggregating with intermediate tables
4. Reduce GROUP BY dimensions

**Example fix:**
```sql
-- Before: Slow exact count
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as dau
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1

-- After: Fast approximate count
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) as dau
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1M', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1
```

## Query Analysis Workflow

When optimizing a slow query, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Add EXPLAIN

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE ...
```

Look for:
- Full table scans (missing time filters)
- High cardinality GROUP BY
- Expensive JOINs
- Missing filters

### Step 2: Check Time Filters

```sql
-- Ensure time filter exists and is specific
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
  OR TD_TIME_RANGE(time, '2024-01-01', '2024-01-31')
```

### Step 3: Reduce Column Count

```sql
-- Select only needed columns
SELECT user_id, event_type, time
-- Not SELECT *
```

### Step 4: Use Approximate Functions

```sql
-- Replace COUNT(DISTINCT) with APPROX_DISTINCT
-- Replace PERCENTILE with APPROX_PERCENTILE
```

### Step 5: Test with LIMIT

```sql
-- Test logic on small subset first
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
LIMIT 1000
```

### Step 6: Use CTAS for Large Results

```sql
-- For queries returning many rows
CREATE TABLE results AS
SELECT ...
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Pre-aggregation Strategy

For frequently-run queries, create pre-aggregated tables.

```sql
-- Daily aggregation job
CREATE TABLE daily_user_events AS
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) as event_count,
  APPROX_DISTINCT(session_id) as sessions
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1, 2

-- Fast queries on pre-aggregated data
SELECT
  date,
  SUM(event_count) as total_events,
  SUM(sessions) as total_sessions
FROM daily_user_events
WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
```

### Incremental Processing

Process large time ranges incrementally.

```sql
-- Instead of processing 1 year at once
-- Process day by day and INSERT INTO result table

-- Day 1
INSERT INTO monthly_summary
SELECT ...
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-1d', 'JST')

-- Day 2
INSERT INTO monthly_summary
SELECT ...
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-2d/-1d', 'JST')

-- etc.
```

### Materialized Views Pattern

Create and maintain summary tables for common queries.

```sql
-- Create summary table once
CREATE TABLE user_daily_summary AS
SELECT
  TD_TIME_STRING(time, 'd!', 'JST') as date,
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) as events,
  APPROX_DISTINCT(page_url) as pages_visited
FROM events
WHERE TD_INTERVAL(time, '-30d', 'JST')
GROUP BY 1, 2

-- Query the summary (much faster)
SELECT
  date,
  AVG(events) as avg_events_per_user,
  AVG(pages_visited) as avg_pages_per_user
FROM user_daily_summary
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

## Best Practices Checklist

Before running a query, verify:

- [ ] Time filter added (TD_INTERVAL or TD_TIME_RANGE)
- [ ] Selecting specific columns (not SELECT *)
- [ ] Using APPROX_DISTINCT for unique counts
- [ ] Using REGEXP_LIKE instead of multiple LIKEs
- [ ] Tested with LIMIT on small dataset first
- [ ] Using CTAS for large result sets
- [ ] All joined tables have time filters
- [ ] GROUP BY uses reasonable cardinality
- [ ] Window functions partition appropriately

## Cost Optimization

Reducing query execution time also reduces cost:

1. **Time filters** - Scan less data
2. **Column selection** - Read less data
3. **Approximate functions** - Use less memory
4. **CTAS** - Avoid expensive JSON serialization
5. **Pre-aggregation** - Query summary tables instead of raw data
